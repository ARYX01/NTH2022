<br/>

This project was assigned by the **Next Talent Hub 2022** event.
It was intended for all students who wish to gain new expertise and explore new technologies together with high-tech companies **Business Solutions** and **Instrumentation Technologies**.
The goal of the workshop was to use **Libera Spark ERXR**, an RF signal generator and a model particle accelerator beam tube with sensors to visualize the beam position.
***Libera Spark*** is a compact beam position processor that offers high-precision position measurement of different beam types (electrons, protons, ions, etc.).

During the project we were mentored by the **best IT specialists** Dean Podgornik, Aleš Vigali, Erik Simonič, Borut Repic, 
 Diane Berte and Tina Zgaga.
